This research is still under development and will be published soon

## Abstract

- Develop a bed exist monitor by PIR camera
- Analyze sleeping quality in computer vision viewpoint

## Recently Progress

### 1. Magic Eraser

Purpose: Solving noise pixel caused by PIR camera<br>
Method: 
- step1: Go through all single pixel
- step2: Calculate the difference between the current point and the surrounding points
- step3: If all difference > threshold, let current pixel = all surround pixelsâ€™ average

### 2. Moving Detection

Purpose: Making sleeping quality analysis<br>
Method: Compare mask image similarity (SSIM)<br>
